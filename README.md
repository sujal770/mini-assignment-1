This Express application functions as both a static website server and a dynamic API provider. When the server starts, it uses Express to serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files from a folder named public. Among these HTML files is a special page called api-demo.html, which includes a button that, when clicked, uses JavaScript to make an asynchronous request (using fetch with async/await) to a specific Express route (/api/items). This route is defined in the backend (app.js) and uses res.json() to send back the contents of a JSON file located in a folder called data. The JSON file contains at least six objects representing items, such as products. When the frontend receives the JSON data, it dynamically updates the webpage by displaying the data in a clean, formatted layout using JavaScript and CSS. This demonstrates how the frontend and backend can communicate in real time using API requests, even though they are served from the same application. The use of Nodemon also ensures the backend server restarts automatically on any changes during development.
